# Potato Disease Classification using TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple TensorFlow project for classifying potato diseases into three categories: Early Blight, Healthy, and Late Blight. The project is designed to demonstrate a basic image classification task using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of potato plants affected by different diseases. The dataset is given in the `PlantVillage` folder in the `training` folder. The dataset is organized into three folders: `Potato___Early_blight`, `Potato___healthy`, and `Potato___Late_blight`, each containing images corresponding to their respective classes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install these packages using `pip`
